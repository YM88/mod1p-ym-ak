**How are you defining success ?**

- Return on investment?
- Revenue?
- Guaranteed box-office hit?
- Social media buzz?

Microsoft has provided some data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB.org. You are not limited to these data sets! If you find other useful data on the web, you are welcome to include it (but this is not a requirement).







Be prepared to answer questions such as:

"how did you pick the question(s) that you did?"
- after analyzing the data and looking at the information we thought these would be the key factors in defining the success of a new movie release

we believe the main factor of success to be the **revenue**

"why are these questions important from a business perspective?"

- helps to make better decisions in terms of choosing the right genres/actors/writers/directors

"how did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?"
- by using the info, datatypes and whether the data has any NA values or not.

"why did you choose a given method or library?"
- to import data frames, analyze, and wrangle them we used pandas. 
- to visualize we used matplotlib

"why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?"
